# Part 3: CloudFront initiation

Now that your files are ready to be served via S3, we will configure CloudFront to make sure that the users of your website will be served over SSL. The secure serving of your website unfortunately cannot be done directly via S3, and that is where CloudFront comes into play. Follow the list of steps below to get it all set up:

1. Go to [AWS CloudFront](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home)
2. Click on the blue button 'Create Distribution'
3. Select the top 'Get Started Button', under the 'Web' heading
4. In the 'Origin Domain Name' field, select your the S3 bucket you just created
5. Scroll down to 'Default Cache Behavior Settings'
6. Next to **Viewer Protocol Policy** select 'Redirect HTTP to HTTPS'
7. Now, scroll further down to 'Distribution Settings'
8. Next to **Price Class** select 'Use Only U.S., Canada and Europe' or leave it as is if you want only the best performance (which obviously is costs more money)
9. In the **Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)** field type `www.domain.com`, press enter and type `domain.com` where 'domain.com' should obviously be replaced by your own domain name
10. Leave the rest of the settings as they are and scroll down, where you hit the 'Create Distribution' button

You have succesfully created your CloudFront distribution! Just be patient as CloudFront is iniating/setting itself up.
