# Configure SSL for CloudFront

As you have just configured your CloudFront setup and as you also requested your SSL certificate, the two can now be 'connected':

1. Go to [CloudFront](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home)
2. Click on the ID of your distributions (the fact that it is possibly not yet deployed does not matter)
3. Click on 'Edit'
4. Next to **SSL Certificate**, hit the radio button saying 'Custom SSL Certificate (example.com)' and select your freshly configured SSL certificate
5. Scroll down and click on 'Yes, Edit'

Now, your website will be served over SSL and your browser will show a 'lock' next to the URL.
