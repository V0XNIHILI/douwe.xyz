# SSL certificates

Now while you can see that the status of creating the distribution is in 'In Progress', we are going to acquire an SSL certificate.

1. Go to [AWS Certificate Manager](https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home)
2. Make sure that your selected region is 'US East (N. Virgina)' as CloudFront only accepts certificates hosted here
3. Click on the blue button 'Request a certificate'
4. Click again on 'Request a certificate'
5. In the 'Domain name' field type your `*.domain.com` where you should replace 'domain.com' by your own domain name
6. Click 'Add another to this certificate' and type `domain.com`
7. Click 'Next' and after that click on 'Review'
8. Finally click on 'Confirm and request'
9. Now, click on 'Continue' as your certificate request has been sent

Now the certificate needs to validated. That is done in the following manner:

1. Under the warning 'Validation not complete', click on `*.domain.com`
2. In this newly opened pane, click on 'Create record in Route 53'
3. Hit 'Create'

All you have to do now is wait for the certificate to be confirmed. This process can take up to 30 minutes, but for me it took around 2 minutes. Grab a coffee and chances are high that as you come back and reload the page that your certificate has been issued.
