# Connecting CloudFront to your domain

Next, as you are probably still waiting on the deploying of your CloudFront Distribution, we will setup CloudFront so that users visiting your website will be served with content straight from CloudFront:

1. Go back to [Route 53](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home)
2. Click on 'Hosted Zones' and click on the correct domain name
3. Hit the top blue button, saying 'Create Record Set'
4. In the pane on the right, select 'Yes' next to **Alias**
5. Click in the 'Alias Target' file and in the options that present themselves, scroll down to your CloudFront Distributions and select it
6. Hit 'Create'
7. Do steps 3-6 again, but now make sure to change the value in the **Name** field to 'www' and the **Alias Target** to `domain.com`

Now, people visiting your website will be served content straight from CloudFront. Please keep in mind that, although S3 and CloudFront should serve/have the same files, CloudFront is always a bit behind due to caching. If you uploaded a new version of your website and immediately want to see the result, you should create an invalidation within your distribution with as input `*`.
