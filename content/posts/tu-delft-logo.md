# How did I come to this?

Recently I was working on a group project here at the university, when we had to create a presentation for a project we just completed. Our group decided to use the standard TU Delft Powerpoint template, which has the logo embroidered into almost every slide.

As the standard font of the template is Microsoft's Arial, I was working on putting some text onto the slides when I suddenly realized that maybe, the TU Delft logo itself was also using Arial. So I quickly opened a new Google Slides, copied the original logo and started typing. Guess what: it's pretty darn similiar.

If you don't believe me, just check for yourself. Below is the original logo .PNG file, below that is the text 'TUDelft' in plain Arial, with the letters 'TU' made bold.

<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 145px; color: black; margin-bottom: -45px;"><b>TU</b><span>Delft</span></div>

Well, tell me: would you be able to spot the difference if they weren't placed above each other? I definitely wouldn't. Although, when you compare them directly, it is visible that the 'TU' part of the logo is more bold than the normal bold type of Arial and that the 'D' in the original logo looks a bit vertically stretched if you ask me.
