# Conclusion and final thoughts

Finally: you have your own website hosted at AWS! As you have seen, it is not super hard or complicated to setup your own web hosting at AWS, it is just a long list of steps to go through.

One you can do after you have followed this guide is installing the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-bundle.html) (command line interface), so you can upload a bunch of files, or for example, the newest version of your website, over the command line with a single command, for example:

```bash
aws s3 sync savetimetable s3://domain.com/folder/ --exclude ".git/*" --exclude ".gitignore" --exclude "README.md" --delete
```

This simple command line syncs your complete working folder with a folder on S3 without including all of git information. The `--delete` takes care of deleting older versions of the files on S3.

We hope you found it easy to follow this guide, as that was the sole intention of this writing this piece! If you have any questions left, you can contact us via [hi@douwe.xyz](mailto:hi@douwe.xyz) and [alex@vinalex.net](mailto:alex@vinalex.net).
