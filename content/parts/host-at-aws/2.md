# Setup file hosting via S3

Now, we will create a place to actually store your website. In AWS, this place is called Simple Storage Service (S3). Follow the steps below to create a bucket, which will eventually hold all of your web files:

1. Open another tab and go the [S3 page](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)
2. Now, hit the blue button saying 'Create bucket'

A new window opens, in which you have select the options for your bucket. Again, follow the following steps closely:

1. In the 'Bucket name' field, fill your domain name in (for example: `domain.com`)
2. Select your region, preferably the one which is closest to you
3. Click 'Next'
4. Click 'Next' again
5. Uncheck the options 'Block new public policies' and 'Block public and cross-account access if bucket ' under '**Manage public bucket policies for this bucket**'
6. Click 'Next' and after this, click 'Create bucket'

Now that your bucket has been created, the setup can continue.

1. Click on your newly created bucket
2. Now, go to the 'Permissions' section
3. Click on the 'Bucket Policy' button
4. Copy the the text below into the newly opened text editor, while replacing `domain.com` by your own domain name:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::domain.com/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

5. Ignore the 'This bucket has public access' and go to the 'Properties' section
6. Click on the 'Static website hosting' block
7. Select 'Use this bucket to host a website'
8. In the 'Index document' field, type `index.html`
9. Click on the 'Save' button

Now, upload a random file or, if you have one, your `index.html` file, to test your setup. While uploading, just hit next every time.
