# Part 7: Redirect to index.html

Now that everything has been setup, you can test your website by going to `domain.com/yourfile.extension`. Verify that the content is served over SSL by looking at the lock icon in your browser.

However, there now is one issue: if we go to `domain.com` we are not automatically presented with the root `index.html` (if there is one). The same behaviour is present for subfolders.

So that's why in this part, we are going to solve this issue:

1. Go to the [AWS Lambda](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home) control panel
2. Make sure that you select 'US East (N. Virginia)' as your location
3. Click on the orange 'Create Function' button
4. In the 'Function name' field enter `serveIndex`
5. Click 'Create function'
6. On this new page, scroll down to the code editor and paste the following code:

```javascript
'use strict';
exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
    
    // Extract the request from the CloudFront event that is sent to Lambda@Edge 
    var request = event.Records[0].cf.request;

    // Extract the URI from the request
    var olduri = request.uri;

    // Match any '/' that occurs at the end of a URI. Replace it with a default index
    var newuri = olduri.replace(/\/$/, '\/index.html');
    
    // Log the URI as received by CloudFront and the new URI to be used to fetch from origin
    console.log("Old URI: " + olduri);
    console.log("New URI: " + newuri);
    
    // Replace the received URI with the URI that includes the index page
    request.uri = newuri;
    
    // Return to CloudFront
    return callback(null, request);

};
```

7. Click on the orange 'Save' button in the right top corner
8. Scroll down and look for 'Execution role'
9. Click on the drop down which says 'Use an existing role' and select 'Create a new role from AWS Policy templates'
10. Enter a name for your role, for example `indexServer`
11. Again, hit 'Save'

Now, before the next couple of steps can be done, we have to allow our newly created user to deploy to Lambda Edge, so we will fix that now:

1. Go to  [IAM](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/roles)
2. On the left side, click on 'Roles'
3. Find the newly created role and click on it
4. In this new window, click on 'Trust relationships'
5. Now, hit the blue 'Edit trust relationship' button
6. Replace the code there with the following code:

```json
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
            "Service": [
               "lambda.amazonaws.com",
               "edgelambda.amazonaws.com"
            ]
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
      }
   ]
}
```

7. Now save the trust policy by clicking on 'Update Trust Policy'

The user role issue has now been fixed, so now we will continue finishing our Lambda redirect function:

1. Go back to your [Lambda function](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/functions)
2. Look for the 'Add triggers' list on the left side of the 'Designer'
3. Scroll down the list and select 'CloudFront'
4. Scroll down and click 'Deploy to Lamba@Edge'
5. Choose your newly created distribution and check the **Confirm deploy to Lambda@Edge** box

Now, you will have to wait for you CloudFront distribution to redeploy. As soon as that is finished,  users, when they go to `domain.com` or `www.domain.com` or `domain.com/`, will now all see the same page, without the URL being changed to `domain.com/index.html`.
