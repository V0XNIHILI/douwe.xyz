# Introduction

In this guide, we will explain how to setup a web hosting environment in AWS for a static website. As we did not find this process to be very intuitive ourselves, we decided to write this guide to enable more people to make use of all of the great static hosting possibilities AWS has to offer.

This guide assumes that you have already created an AWS account, which if you haven't, you can do [here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start). Also, the guide assumes that you have your domain parked with GoDaddy. However, it is also applicable to other domain name providers.

We chose to write this guide in a very step-by-step manner as we quite enjoy using those guides ourselves. Our recommendation is to open this document on one side of your screen and open your browser on the other side. This works very well as this document **exactly** describes how to setup everything up.

If you follow the steps in this document you are able to launch your website within 40 minutes, including the time you have to wait for AWS to initiate everything.
