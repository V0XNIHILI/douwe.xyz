# Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Douwe den Blanken and I'm a 19 year old Aerospace Engineering student from the
Netherlands. I am passionate about almost anything that goes faster than 250 km/h, independent of
whether it's travelling on four wheels or being carried by two wings. I love to play football in the
summer and enjoy to go ice skating in the winter.

## Development

I simply love to create, independent of whether it's designing and thinking up the aircraft of the future, the
next electric sports car or programming a solution for some problem I ran into.

Currently, most of my hours are spent writing code for web applications. Having
knowledge of and experience with fullstack web development completely deployed at AWS, I am skilled
in React, TypeScript, GraphQL, PostgreSQL and Docker and really enjoy working with these
technologies.

I am also the owner and founder of [Webcellence](https://webcellence.nl). Together with my brother,
we design, develop and build quality websites for local businesses and entrepeneurs. We also create
logos, brochures and business cards and do the photography for the websites.
