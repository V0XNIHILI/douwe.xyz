# Domain setup

The first part of this guide will be on how to setup your domain name within AWS.  Below is a clear list of steps on how to do this:

1. Sign in to the AWS console and go to [Route 53](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/)
2. From the menu on the left side of the screen, select 'Hosted zones'
3. Hit the blue button 'Create Hosted Zone'
4. In the newly opened menu, enter your domain name (for example: `domain.com`) and make sure that the dropdown is on 'Public Hosted Zone'

Now, your DNS has to be updated to be pointing towards AWS. Please keep in mind that the following steps will only be exactly applicable to domains bought at GoDaddy, although the same concept can be carried through to other domain name providers.

1. Open a new tab and log in to [GoDaddy](https://sso.godaddy.com/login?realm=idp&app=dcc&path=%2f)
2. Go to the ['My Products' page](https://account.godaddy.com/products/)
3. Under the dropdown 'Domains', find the domain which you want to setup hosting for and click on the 'DNS' button on the right
4. On this newly opened page, scroll down to 'Name Servers'
5. Hit the blue button below 'Name Servers' which says 'Edit'
6. In this dropdown, select the option 'Custom'
7. Go back to your AWS console tab
8. Copy the different domains in the 'Value' column of the Type 'NS' (without the trailing point) and paste them in the list of name servers on the GoDaddy page
9. If you don't have enough inputs to fill in all of your name servers, hit the 'Add Name Server' button
10. When you are done copying the contents, hit the 'Save' button.

Now that your domain's DNS is transfered to AWS, the real fun can begin.
